# University_Network_Design #

The University Area Network design is about designing a topology of a network that is a LAN (Local Area Network) for a university in which various computers of different departments and buildings are set up so that they can interact and communicate with each other by interchanging data. To design a network for a University which connects various departments and buildings to each otherâ€™s, it puts forward communication among them. One of the purpose of networking is to reduce isolated users. The systems should be capable of communicating with others and should provide the desired information.

This University Network design is to provide a well-connected, secure, reliable, dependable communication among different departments. Several departments can simply split the required data without any problem and can exchange their data without going physically to them thus conserving time and energy.

In this project, I have designed a University Network using Cisco Packet Tracer that uses a networking topology implemented using servers, routers, switches, and end devices in a multiple area network. I have covered all the necessary features that are required for a network to function properly.
